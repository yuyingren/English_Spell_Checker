This extraordinary nature of Washington's capacitiesthis impossibility of analyzing and understanding the elements and methods of his wisdomhave led some persons to doubt whether, intellectually, he was of great superiority; but the publicthe communitynever doubted of the transcendent eminence of Washington's abilities . From the first moment of his appearance as the chief, the recognition of him, from one end of the country to the other, as THE MANthe leader, the counsellor, the infallible in suggestion and in conductwas immediate and universal . From that moment to the close of the scene, the national confidence in his capacity was as spontaneous, as enthusiastic, as immovable, as it was in his integrity . Particular persons, affected by the untoward course of events, sometimes questioned his sufficiency; but the nation never questioned it, nor would allow it to be questioned . Neither misfortune, nor disappointment, nor accidents, nor delay, nor the protracted gloom of years, could avail to disturb the public trust in him . It was apart from circumstances; it was beside the action of caprice; it was beyond all visionary, and above all changeable feelings . It was founded on nothing extraneous; not upon what he had said or done, but upon what he was . They saw something in the man, which gave them assurance of a nature and destiny of the highest elevationsomething inexplicable, but which inspired a complete satisfaction . We feel that this reliance was wise and right; but why it was felt, or why it was right, we are as much to seek as those who came under the direct impression of his personal presence . It is not surprising, that the world, recognizing in this man a nature and a greatness which philosophy cannot explain, should revere him almost to religion.
