These considerations occur naturally to the mind in contemplating the fame of Washington . An attentive examination of the whole subject, and of all that can contribute to the formation of a sound opinion, results in the belief that General Washington's mental abilities illustrate the very highest type of greatness . His mind, probably, was one of the very greatest that was ever given to mortality . Yet it is impossible to establish that position by a direct analysis of his character, or conduct, or productions . When we look at the incidents or the results of that great careerwhen we contemplate the qualities by which it is marked, from its beginning to its endthe foresight which never was surprised, the judgment which nothing could deceive, the wisdom whose resources were incapable of exhaustioncombined with a spirit as resolute in its official duties as it was moderate in its private pretensions, as indomitable in its public temper as it was gentle in its personal tonewe are left in wonder and reverence . But when we would enter into the recesses of that mindwhen we would discriminate upon its construction, and reason upon its operationswhen we would tell how it was composed, and why it excelledwe are entirely at fault . The processes of Washington's understanding are entirely hidden from us . What came from it, in counsel or in action, was the life and glory of his country; what went on within it, is shrouded in impenetrable concealment . Such elevation in degree of wisdom, amounts almost to a change of kind, in nature, and detaches his intelligence from the sympathy of ours . We cannot see him as he was, because we are not like him . The tones of the mighty bell were heard with the certainty of Time itself, and with a force that vibrates still upon the air of life, and will vibrate for ever . But the clock-work, by which they were regulated and given forth, we can neither see nor understand . In fact, his intellectual abilities did not exist in an analytical and separated form; but in a combined and concrete state . They``moved altogether when they moved at all ."They were in no degree speculative, but only practical . They could not act at all in the region of imagination, but only upon the field of reality . The sympathies of his intelligence dwelt exclusively in the national being and action . Its interests and energies were absorbed in them . He was nothing out of that sphere, because he was every thing there . The extent to which he was identified with the country is unexampled in the relations of individual men to the community . During the whole period of his life he was the thinking part of the nation . He was its mind; it was his image and illustration . If we would classify and measure him, it must be with nations and not with individuals.
