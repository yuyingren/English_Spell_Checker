Society always needs such men as William Hogarthtrue, stern mento grapple with and overthrow the vices which spring upthe very weeds both of poverty and luxury, the latter filled with the more bitter and subtle poison . Calling to mind the period, we the more honor the great artist's resolution; if the delicacy of our improved times is offended by what may seem deformity upon his canvas, we must remember that we do not shrink from Hogarth's coarseness, but from the coarseness he labored, by exposing, to expel . He painted what Smollett, and Fielding, and Richardson wrote far more offensively; but he surpassed the novelists both in truth and in intention . He painted without sympathizing with his subjects, whom he lashed with unsparing bitterness or humor . He never idealized a vice into a virtuehe never compromised a fact, much less a principle.
