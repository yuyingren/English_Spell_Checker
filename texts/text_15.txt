Professor Leslie, in his eloquent and valuable Lectures on Painting, delivered in the spring of the present year to the students of the Royal Academy, has nobly vindicated Hogarth as an artist and a man, in words that all who heard will long remember .``Hogarth ,"he said,``it is true, is often gross; but it must be remembered that he painted in a less fastidious age than ours, and that his great object was to expose vice . Debauchery is always made by him detestable, never attractive ."Charles Lamb, one of the best of his commentators, who has viewed his labors in a kindred spirit, speaking of one of his most elaborate and varied works, the``Election Entertainment ,"asks,``What is the result left on the mind? Is it an impression of the vileness and worthlessness of our species? Or is not the general feeling which remains after the individual faces have ceased to act sensibly on the mind, a kindly one in favor of the species?"Leslie speaks of his``high species of humor, pregnant with moral meanings ,"and no happier choice of phrase could characterize his many works . Lamb, with true discrimination, says:``All laughter is not of a dangerous or soul-hardening tendency . There is the petrifying sneer of a demon, which excludes and kills love, and there is the cordial laughter of a man, which implies and cherishes it . ''
