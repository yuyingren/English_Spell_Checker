Hogarth's character of mind, evidenced in his works and proved by his biography, is so perfectly honest, open, home-bred English, that we claim him with prideas belonging exclusively to England . His originality is of English growth; his satire broad, bold, fair-play English . He was no screened assassin of character, either with pen or pencil; no journalist's hack to stab in secretconcealing his name, or assuming a forged one; no masked caricaturist, responsible to none . His philosophy was of the straightforward, clear-sighted English school; his theoriesstern, simple, and unadornedthoroughly English; his determinationproved in his love as well as in his hatequite English; there is a firmness of purpose, a rough dignity, a John-Bull look in his broad intelligent face; the very fur round his cap must have been plain English rabbit-skin! No matter what``schools"were in fashion, Hogarth created and followed his own; no matter what was done, or said, or written, Hogarth maintained his opinion unflinchingly; he was not to be moved or removed from his resolve . His mind was vigorous and inflexible, and withal, keen and acute; and though the delicacy of his taste in this more refined age may be matter of question, there can be no doubt as to his integrity and uprightness of purposein his determination to denounce vice, and by that means cherish virtue.
